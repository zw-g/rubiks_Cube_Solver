## rubiks_Cube_Solver - Java

To run the program you just have to run.java

Take the opportunity of an AI class project to observe different possibilities to solve rubik's cube.
I have started with research on how to develop an AI that will solve rubik's cube without any
knowledge, but in the end most of the paper states that this method only works if you have
shuffled 1-7 times.

I have also tried to develop my own AI without any knowledge using BFS, theoretically it should
find the possible result, but in the end, it take much longer to find a result that work, and
sometime it won’t be able to find a result

Then I decided to try to develop an AI with human knowledge and found some bugs in the
rubiks cube itself. I have splitted one job into 7 different steps just like how a beginner would
learn Rubik’s cube. In the end it turned out to be great. It will be able to solve any Cube I throw
at it and solve it very fast.
